            <div>To Whom It May Concern:
                <br><br></div>
            <div>I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Jordon since the beginning of the spring semester of 2018. Jordon works as a Teacher Assistant in the T-Shirt printing shop located on the campus of Clovis West High School. It’s been a joy getting to know Jordon; he’s such a driven and goal oriented individual. I enjoy working with him knowing that he has the necessary skills needed to successfully accomplish his daily tasks. Jordon has many great qualities and skills such as a strong work ethic, reliable, responsible, punctual, and excellent at time management. Many of these personal and professional strengths can carry him to success in life. Jordon is a dependable young man that works hard to accomplish any task given to him. Jordon is a hard worker and dedicated individual, he has the maturity to value the opportunity given to him and seize every opportunity that comes his way. I can say without hesitation that given the opportunity I would recommend him for anything. Jordon will astonish you with his commitment and drive. I’ve had many TA’s throughout the years and I will never forget my time spent working with Jordon and how much determination and desire this individual has at succeeding in his goals. <br><br> </div>
